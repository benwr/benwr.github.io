                This information is current as of October 2017. I'd guess that there's
                an 80% chance that it's outdated as you're reading it.

                I'm Ben. I live in San Francisco, and work as a programmer at
                <a href="https://getcruise.com">Cruise Automation</a> on
                the prediction team. Most of my time is spent sleeping,
                writing code for work and pleasure, thinking about interesting
                things, and consuming various media. My favorite things to
                think about recently include robotics, artificial intelligence and
                machine learning, metaethics, anthropics, logic puzzles, and problem
                solving of many types. I'm somewhat involved in the effective
                altruism community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Historically, I've spent some time knitting, reading, building hobby
                electronics, change ringing, and hiking.

                I'm originally from Blacksburg, Virginia, and lived there through
                my undergraduate degree, which was in Computer Engineering.
                In Blacksburg I spent an unusual amount of time in Bollo's Cafe
                and Bakery, and helped to start <a href="http://hacksburg.org">Hacksburg</a>,
                Blacksburg's first community hackerspace.
            </p>
            <p>I have a pretty sporadic online presence; you can
                <a href="mailto://b@w-r.me">email me</a>, add me on
                <a href="https://facebook.com/benwr">Facebook</a> or
                <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/benwr">LinkedIn</a>, or see some of my
                personal projects at my <a href="https://github.com/benwr">GitHub</a>.
