    I'm Ben. I live in San Francisco, and work as a programmer at
    <a href="https://getcruise.com">Cruise Automation</a> on
    the prediction team. Most of my time is spent sleeping,
    writing code for work and pleasure, thinking about interesting
    things, and consuming various media. My favorite things to
    think about recently include robotics, artificial intelligence and
    machine learning, metaethics, anthropics, logic puzzles, and problem
    solving. I'm somewhat involved in the effective altruism community.

    Historically, I've spent some time knitting, reading, building hobby
    electronics, change ringing, and hiking.

    I'm originally from Blacksburg, Virginia, and lived there through
    my undergraduate degree, which was in Computer Engineering.
    In Blacksburg I spent an unusual amount of time in Bollo's Cafe
    and Bakery, and helped to start <a href="http://hacksburg.org">Hacksburg</a>,
    Blacksburg's first community hackerspace.

<p>I have a pretty sporadic online presence; you can

    <a href="https://facebook.com/benwr">Facebook</a> or

    personal projects at my <a href="https://github.com/benwr">GitHub</a>.
