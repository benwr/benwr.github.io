  I'm Ben; I live in San Francisco. I write software and do research,
  often aimed at <a href="https://80000hours.org">improving or saving
  the world</a>. I love thinking about artificial intelligence, philosophy,
  cryptography, and robotics.
</p>
<p>
  I'm originally from Blacksburg, Virginia, and lived there through
  my undergraduate degree, which was in Computer Engineering.
  In Blacksburg I spent an unusual amount of time in Bollo's Cafe
  and Bakery, and helped to start <a href="http://hacksburg.org">Hacksburg</a>,
  Blacksburg's first community hackerspace.
