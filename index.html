  I'm Ben; I live in San Francisco. I do research and write software,
  often aimed at <a href="https://80000hours.org">improving or saving
  the world</a>. I love thinking about artificial intelligence, philosophy,
  cryptography, and robotics.
</p>
<p>
  As of mid-2025, I work as senior researcher at
  <a href="https://palisaderesearch.org">Palisade Research</a>, trying to think
  clearly about risks from advanced AI agents, and part-time as acting director
  at <a href="https://aiimpacts.org">AI Impacts</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In the past I've done research engineering work at the
  <a href="https://intelligence.org">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a>
  and <a href="https://redwoodresearch.org">Redwood Research</a>, built a
  novel cryptographic database for screening DNA synthesis orders for biological
  hazards at <a href="https://securedna.org/">SecureDNA</a>, and helped build the
  on-car planning and prediction software for
  <a href="https://www.gm.com/innovation/autonomous-driving">Cruise Automation</a>'s
  self-driving cars.

  I'm originally from Blacksburg, Virginia, and lived there through
  my undergraduate degree, which was in Computer Engineering.
  In Blacksburg I spent an unusual amount of time in Bollo's Cafe
  and Bakery, and helped to start <a href="http://hacksburg.org">Hacksburg</a>,
  Blacksburg's first community hackerspace.

  things to, you can also send me email at

  read things submitted via the form.
