This is a list of some projects I've worked on, including some stuff for class, some
for extracurricular activities, and some for no reason other than that I was bored.

## Application of Neural Networks to Prediction of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ##

Basically, NASA and UW produced [this data set](http://jisao.washington.edu/datasets/ndvi/)
of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). It indicates how much vegetation is
at a particular spot on the earth's surface. The data comes from NOAA's AVHRR, a satellite imager
that measures reflected light on the earth's surface at particular wavelengths.

Sean Thweatt and I were in [ECE 4984](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~f13ece4984ece5984/),
Introduction to Machine Learning and Perception, at Virginia Tech in Fall 2014.
For the final project, we made
[this poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6QINlqDWlIAVndqclpvQThfWXM/edit?usp=sharing),
which won us the best undergraduate project prize. The idea was pretty basic: Use a simple
neural network trained on [temperature and precipitation data](http://jisao.washington.edu/datasets/ud/) from
the University of Delaware, to see if we could significantly beat climatology for predicting NDVI.
We did a fair job, but I'd like to see if I could do better given more time.

## Boost Converter ##

A simple project Chris Buck and I made for the Virginia Tech HKN ANDY Board Competition:
a boost converter from passive components and a 555 timer.
