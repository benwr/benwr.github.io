A thing I really appreciate about my social circle: people are unusually happy
to exchange money for things and vice versa, and comfortable with making deals
that involve a monetary component. E.g. someone might ask "would anyone do X
for me?" And of course if you do X without any negotiation that's nice of you
and you'll get social credit and stuff just like normal, but you can *also*
just say "I'd be *excited* about doing it in trade for $Y". And people
basically won't judge you negatively for this. It's great because (a) sometimes
you do X and get $Y and are excited about it, (b) sometimes someone does X for
you and you pay them $Y and you're happy about it, (c) sometimes you don't do X
because actually it *wouldn't have been overall good for you to do it*.

And even when no money changes hands, people are comfortable expressing how
much they want things in terms of dollars, and you can decide whether to do
something based on whether it would be worth it to you in principle (this
concept is basically the economic idea of Kaldor-Hicks efficiency).

Over the last decade I've become a lot more sympathetic to libertarian
ideologies, and part of that has come from understanding the arguments, but a
big part of it has come from just being embedded in this world where it's
really obvious how price signals are useful. I'm really grateful to the people
who introduced these norms to the community, because they've really improved my
life.
