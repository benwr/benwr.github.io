My mother gave a really great talk about empathy at [TEDxVirginiaTech][tedxvt] 
today, and while I did feel that I got a lot of value from it, I'd just like to
express a longstanding unease about TED talks: I really feel like TED talks are 
the intellectual equivalent of "N X’s that will make you Y." They aim to
"really make you think." And anyone who recognizes that phrase as the cliche 
that it is will also recognize that, often, works that aim to “really make 
you think”, instead become condescending and simplistic. 
 
The TED talks that I have found valuable haven't been about "Ideas Worth 
Spreading," in the strictest sense. They've all been performance art, to some 
degree: Poetry, music, brief glimpses at a new perspective. Ten-minute talks 
are not a good format for data, or deep philosophy.
