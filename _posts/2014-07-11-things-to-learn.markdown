Today I realized how much the people around me know.  This is my fourth summer
as an intern, this time at [CMU](http://cmu.edu)'s 
[Robotics Institute](http://ri.cmu.edu), in Sidd Srinivasa's Personal Robotics
Lab. Two people gave practice talks in the lab today. The first was on a proposed
method for planning with hierarchies of models. Planning is an area of
artificial intelligence. You can probably guess that it's about planning how to
perform some action or achieve some goal, and while it's a topic that's very
interesting to me, I know almost nothing about it. Every permanent member of the
lab nodded and asked pertinent questions.

The second talk was on a machine learning method for choosing which tests to
perform in preparation for some task. The context was specific to robotics,
but the method could be applied to nearly any situation where you need to gather
information about the world before deciding what to do. This was a topic I'm
more familiar with, and so I understood it and asked a few of my own questions.
It may sound related to the planning problem (most problems in the CS-side of
robotics are of the form, "How can we get the robot to figure out X?"), but the
truth is that understanding the second talk required an entirely different set of
knowledge: Statistics and complexity theory and optimization.

Later in the day, a couple lab members were having a friendly discussion about
voting systems and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. My grad student friend was
working on a poster she's presenting on Human-Robot Interaction, which is a
discipline concerned with how to make robots coexist effectively with humans,
and requires a much softer background and focus on human factors. Last week
she gave a practice talk on the mechanics of manipulation.

These people know about electronics, about how to build things, about kinematics
and dynamics, about control theory, and about how to set up and maintain a package
repository and a networked filesystem. I had a conversation with one of them
about weird interfaces to the brain. Another, who used to be an animator for
Pixar, taught a bunch of us how to do realistic sketching.

And here I am, struggling to get my computer to turn joystick commands into
robot joint speeds.

They aren't much older than me (the one working on the HRI poster is actually
younger by a couple months). Even Sidd can't be older than 35. My natural
reaction is to think, "crap. I'm not as smart as I thought. _these_ people are
really extraordinary." Fortunately for me, I've heard enough encouragement and
admiration throughout my life that I immediately counter that thought with
the question "how can I be more like them?"

So I'm making a [list of things to learn](/learn.html), and where to learn them.
I'll confront myself with it every once in a while (maybe set up a MOTD in my
zshrc that reminds me?). Maybe one day I'll be worthy of where I've found myself
this summer.
