I've recently been reading the book _The Tao is Silent_, by Raymond Smullyan,
and it's full of so many well-expressed, simple, interesting, hilarious,
confusing ideas that it feels kind of like eating gummy candies for my brain.
Anyway, I especially like these two quotes from a chapter titled "Is God a
Taoist?" wherein a mortal has a conversation with God about free will and God's
nature.

> [God:] It is the same with a human being. A creature from another planet may
> look at him purely impersonally as a mere collection of atomic particles
> behaving according to strictly prescribed physical laws. He may have no more
> feeling for the personality of a human than the average human has for an ant.
> Yet an ant has just as much individual personality as a human to beings like
> myself who really know the ant. To look at something impersonally is no more
> correct or incorrect than to look at it personally, but in general, the
> better you get to know something, the more personal it becomes.

...

> Mortal: Well, are my acts determined by the laws of nature or aren't they?
>
> God: The word **determined** here is subtly but powerfully misleading and has
> contributed so much to the confusions of the free will versus determinism
> controversies. Your acts are certainly in accordance with the laws of nature,
> but to say they are **determined** by the laws of nature creates a totally
> misleading psychological image which is that your will could somehow be in
> conflict with the laws of nature and that the latter is somehow more powerful
> than you, and could "determine" your acts whether you liked it or not. But it
> is simply impossible for your will to ever conflict with natural law. You and
> natural law are really one and the same.
