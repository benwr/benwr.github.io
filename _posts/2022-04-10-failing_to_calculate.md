The most common way I lose when playing a strategy game is by "failing to
calculate".

Most interesting strategy games are extremely hard to play optimally if you're
a human: In order to play perfectly, you'd need to consider astronomically many
possible games. When we learn strategy games, we typically learn heuristics
(for example, "what resources have I accumulated?", or "How many pawns are
worth a knight?") that are easy to evaluate, and are correlated with winning.
And learning a few of these heuristics puts you way ahead of people who haven't
learned them.

But there are (at least) two other important skills you need for winning
strategy games.

The first is discovering new heuristics. You'll do some of this without even
thinking about it, as you play the game: "Heuristics", as I'm using the term
here, includes explicit ones like "how many pawns for a knight" as well as
implicit ones, like "does this *feel* like a good move to me?".


The second skill, which I find is the hardest, is *noticing when to stop
relying on heuristics, and buckle down and calculate the consequences of your
actions*. Once you have the heuristics, it's extremely tempting to just play
through games as quickly as you can using those heuristics. Calculating takes
mental energy that good heuristics mostly avoid. But throughout the game, there
are going to be chances to think concretely about consequences and incentives,
and if you skip over those you'll be missing the most important opportunities
for getting an edge.

And if you've survived to the endgame intact, the first player to notice that
it's the endgame, and to start exploring the whole game tree, is going to win.

More generally, there are different levels of heuristics, where "higher-level"
heuristics are extremely easy to calculate, but often less informatiave, and
"lower-level" ones are harder to calculate and more informative. The generalized
version of "buckling down and calculating" is "moving down the heuristic ladder".
At the bottom of this ladder are heuristics that are actually just memorized or
compressed calculation.

This is important because the world is, from one perspective, made up entirely
of games like this.
