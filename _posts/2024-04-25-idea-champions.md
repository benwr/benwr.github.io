Ideas-having-champions is a natural feature of the world with at least some
positive effects: every individual becoming a dispassionate truthseeker in all
contexts would not be an unmitigated good. I wrote this in
[a LessWrong comment](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vfjptEJ2oahLqRyZz/justice-cherryl?commentId=HQSHAKfdL8BBzgPLg)
a while ago:

I think this feature of reality is pretty useful, and society does in fact use
it; most obviously in the legal system.

I don't really know what to do with this info, but it feels pretty important.
