A [novice](http://benwr.net) by chance met [Stallman](https://stallman.org/) pushing a heavy cart on the
[silver road](http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/?route=SILVER).
The novice asked to help, and Stallman agreed.

When they sat down to rest, the novice asked Stallman about how to best apply himself, that he might become
a better hacker and do good. "Hack," Stallman replied, "And, if you have time later, help me unload this cart."

Upon hearing this, the novice was enlightened.
