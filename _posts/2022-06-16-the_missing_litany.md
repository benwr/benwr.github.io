I wish to take whatever action will best bring about what I value.<br />
I wish to become whatever person will most manifest what I value.


There is no virtue in clinging to yesterday's expectations,<br />
and no vice in hunting what matters.


I can make the best possible choice - and I can do nothing better!<br />
May I seek what is worthy - and nothing else.
