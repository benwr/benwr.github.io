### From the chapter "Is God a Taoist?" ###
---

    [God:] It is the same with a human being. A creature from another planet may
    look at him purely impersonally as a mere collection of atomic particles
    behaving according to strictly prescribed physical laws. He may have no more
    feeling for the personality of a human than the average human has for an ant.
    Yet an ant has just as much individual personality as a human to beings like
    myself who really know the ant. To look at something impersonally is no more
    correct or incorrect than to look at it personally, but in general, the
    better you get to know something, the more personal it becomes.

...

    Mortal: Well, are my acts determined by the laws of nature or aren't they?
    
    God: The word _determined_ here is subtly but powerfully misleading and has
    contributed so much to the confusions of the free will versus determinism
    controversies. Your acts are certainly in accordance with the laws of nature,
    but to say they are _determined_ by the laws of nature creates a totally
    misleading psychological image which is that your will could somehow be in
    conflict with the laws of nature and that the latter is somehow more powerful
    than you, and could "determine" your acts whether you liked it or not. But it
    is simply impossible for your will to ever conflict with natural law. You and
    natural law are really one and the same.
