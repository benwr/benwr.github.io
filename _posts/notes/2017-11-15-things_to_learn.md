There's an increasing number of things I feel I need to know but don't.
This is a list of some of them.

It's easier to pick out things that are sort of math-y or technical, though
there are definitely lots of other things I want to be better at.

These are arranged by how much I feel like I ought to know them.
I've learned a little bit about most of these, but I need to learn
a lot more.
